Finally I Started a blog ... 
After many many tests with wordpress,jumla etc.. i decided to use github pages 
i think that for professonal plog this hosting and tehclogigy is the best , to create a post i can use HTML or Markdown and it vary vary easy to publish pages just write on your leptop and push via git . 

Thanks JONATHAN MCGLONE for the [Good tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) on GitHub pages 
This neat site is  powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to write my posts.
