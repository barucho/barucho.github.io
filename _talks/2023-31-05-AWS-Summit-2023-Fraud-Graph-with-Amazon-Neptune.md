The Graph Model has become increasingly popular, especially in use cases such as fraud detection, identity resolution, knowledge graphs and recommendation engines. Amazon Neptune is a fast, fully managed graph database service that makes it easy to build and run applications that work with highly connected datasets. Fraud hides itself in isolation. It exploits our failure to assess a transaction in the context of other recent transactions: patterns of fraudulent behavior emerge only when we connect many seemingly discrete data points and events. A fraud graph connects the entities participating in retail and financial transactions.
