At Wix Engineering, we are using JSON in blobs Data Type as far back as MySQL 5.5. In this talk, Baruch shares both our wins and losses, our successes and our challenges, when it came to migrating our blob JSON data to JSON data types, and how we use the new data type to improve search time and reduce IO cost.
