excerpt: 'XA transactions are not a very familiar concept to lots of people and therefore hardly used. An XA transaction is a two-phase commit protocol that supports distributed transactions that updates multiple relational databases. It involves a transaction manager that monitors this global transaction. XA makes sure that transactional updates are committed in all of the participating databases in this global transaction, or are fully rolled back out of all of the databases, reverting to the state prior to the start of the transaction. XA transactions are also useful when you need to coordinate a transaction between different databases.'
